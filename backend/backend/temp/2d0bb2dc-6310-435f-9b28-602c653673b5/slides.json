We\u2019ll also look into the different ways in which you can interact with Google Cloud, including our web user interface, command-line interface, and our mobile apps.

    "speaker_notes": "This hierarchy is made up of four levels, and starting from the bottom up they are: resources, projects, folders, and an organization node. At the \ufb01rst level are resources. These represent virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, Virtual Private Networks (VPCs), tables in BigQuery, or anything else in Google Cloud. Resources get organized into projects, which sit on the second level. Projects can be organized into folders, or even subfolders. These sit at the third level. And then at the top level is an organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization."

    "speaker_notes": "It\u2019s important to understand this resource hierarchy, as it directly relates to how policies are managed and applied when using Google Cloud. Policies can be de\ufb01ned at the project, folder, and organization node levels. Some Google Cloud services allow policies to be applied to individual resources, too. Policies are also inherited downward. This means that if you apply a policy to a folder, it will also apply to all of the projects within that folder."

Projects are the basis for enabling and using Google Cloud services, like managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and enabling other Google services. Each project is a separate compartment, and each resource belongs to exactly one project. Projects can have different owners and users, as they\u2019re billed and managed separately."
