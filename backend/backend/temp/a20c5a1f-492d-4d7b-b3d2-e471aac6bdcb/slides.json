In this section of the course, we\u2019ll see how resources get organized with projects, and how access to those resources gets shared with the right part of a workforce through a tool called Identity and Access Management, or IAM. We\u2019ll also look into the different ways in which you can interact with Google Cloud, including our web user interface, command-line interface, and our mobile apps."
