We\u2019ll see how resources are organized with projects and how access is shared through Identity and Access Management (IAM). We will also explore the different ways you can interact with Google Cloud, including the web user interface, command-line interface, and mobile apps."

For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Google Cloud resources. Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders give teams the ability to delegate administrative rights so that they can work independently."

Resources represent virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, VPCs, BigQuery tables, or anything else in Google Cloud. Resources are organized into projects. Projects can be organized into folders, or even subfolders. At the top level is the organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization."

    "speaker_notes": "The resource hierarchy in Google Cloud is important to understand because it directly relates to how policies are managed and applied. Policies can be defined at the project, folder, and organization node levels, and some Google Cloud services allow policies to be applied to individual resources. Policies are inherited downward, meaning that if you apply a policy to a folder, it will also apply to all of the projects within that folder. This structure helps manage permissions and access control effectively."
