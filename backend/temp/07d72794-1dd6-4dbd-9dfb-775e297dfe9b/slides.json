    "speaker_notes": "The Google Cloud Resource Hierarchy is made up of four levels, and starting from the bottom up they are: resources, projects, folders, and an organization node. At the \ufb01rst level are resources, representing virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, Virtual Private Networks (VPCs), tables in BigQuery, or anything else in Google Cloud. Resources get organized into projects, which sit on the second level. Projects can be organized into folders, or even subfolders at the third level. And then at the top level is an organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization."

Policies can be de\ufb01ned at the project, folder, and organization node levels. Some Google Cloud services allow policies to be applied to individual resources, too. Policies are also inherited downward. This means that if you apply a policy to a folder, it will also apply to all of the projects within that folder."
