In this section of the course, we\u2019ll see how resources get organized with projects, and how access to those resources gets shared with the right part of a workforce through a tool called Identity and Access Management, or IAM. We\u2019ll also look into the different ways in which you can interact with Google Cloud, including our web user interface, command-line interface, and our mobile apps."

For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Google Cloud resources. Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders give teams the ability to delegate administrative rights so that they can work independently."

    "speaker_notes": "This hierarchy is made up of four levels, and starting from the bottom up they are: resources, projects, folders, and an organization node. At the \ufb01rst level are resources. These represent virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, Virtual Private Networks (VPCs), tables in BigQuery, or anything else in Google Cloud. Resources get organized into projects, which sit on the second level. Projects can be organized into folders, or even subfolders. These sit at the third level. And then at the top level is an organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization."

Policies can be de\ufb01ned at the project, folder, and organization node levels. Some Google Cloud services allow policies to be applied to individual resources, too. Policies are also inherited downward. This means that if you apply a policy to a folder, it will also apply to all of the projects within that folder."

Each project functions as an isolated entity, containing resources that belong exclusively to it. Projects can be assigned to different owners and users, with separate billing and management for each. They are independent compartments that operate within the broader structure of the Organization node."

The project ID is a globally unique identifier assigned by Google and cannot be changed after creation. Project names are user-created, not necessarily unique, and mutable. Google Cloud assigns each project a unique project number, mainly for internal tracking purposes."

Resources within these folders inherit the policies and permissions defined at the folder level. This structure is useful for grouping projects by department, enabling independent administration and consistent policy enforcement across related resources."
