    ],
    "speaker_notes": "An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a financial instrument similar to investment funds. The ETFs are listed on stock exchanges which offers an alternative method for indirectly investing in international equities. ETFs often mirror stock indices like the S&P 500. Benefits of ETFs include lower management costs, easier administration, and greater diversification compared to conventional mutual funds. The study focuses on emerging market ETFs, representing countries across Asia-Pacific and Latin America, including Brazil, Chile, Mexico, China, and India, due to their rapid growth and potential for higher returns."

    "speaker_notes": "Stock market prediction has been a challenge due to the chaotic properties of stock information. The evolution of prediction methods includes traditional statistical techniques, and machine learning algorithms to handle market data complexity. Neural networks are a commonly used model to find nonlinear and nonadditive data relations. Specific machine learning strategies like RBM, RNN, CNN, and LSTM have also shown remarkable performance in stock prediction. The study focuses on systematically identifying salient features rather than introducing new MLP variants."

The methodology is based on the CRISP-DM process, aiming to discriminate the best indicators, reduce the data to be processed, and assist investors in determining stock market behavior. The study uses the Pandas Technical Analysis library, containing over 200 tunable technical indicators, to analyze feature selection methods."

This period excludes economic changes caused by global pandemics. The focus is on BlackRock\u2019s ETFs: ECH, EWZ, and IVV, representing emerging and developed markets. The methodology involves calculating technical features, processing data with the CRISP-DM methodology, conducting feature analysis, and evaluating the performance of selected features using a Multilayer Perceptron or MLP model."

    "speaker_notes": "The objective is to improve the accuracy of multiclass classification in machine learning. This is done through exploratory analysis and reduction of the input space. Feature selection reduces dimensionality by selecting the subset of features that provide more information and dropping the redundant ones. The techniques used for selecting the most relevant characteristics include Low Variance, Chi-Squared, LASSO, Tree-based Feature Selection, Pearson\u2019s Correlation, Principal Feature Analysis, Mean Absolute Difference (MAD), and Dispersion Ratio (DR)."

This involves calculating technical indicators, class assignments, data normalization, and cleaning. Statistical measures are used to identify salient features. The algorithm employs an MLP in a K-fold cross-validation setup, with K = 10, to assess the model\u2019s accuracy for each cross-validation partition. The objective is to identify the most salient extracted features of each ETF in the dataset."

    "speaker_notes": "The results show that selecting a subset of features can provide better results using fewer computational resources. A good selection of features can improve the efficiency of the computational resources while attaining similar or even better prediction results. In each ETF analyzed, the set Selected(5) attains a better accuracy prediction, between 77.82 and 80.27%, than using the complete set of features while using only between 4.16 and 5.09% of the features. Moreover, reducing the dimension of the dataset allows construction of a model with a reduced topology, with fewer freedom degrees and redundant features, which could reduce the training and prediction time."
