    "speaker_notes": "Compute Engine offers automatically applied sustained-use discounts, which are automatic discounts that you get for running a virtual-machine instance for a signi\ufb01cant portion of the billing month. Speci\ufb01cally, when you run an instance for more than 25% of a month, Compute Engine automatically gives you a discount for every incremental minute you use for that instance. Custom virtual machine types allow Compute Engine virtual machines to be \ufb01ne-tuned with optimal amounts of vCPU and memory for their applications, so that you can tailor your pricing for your workloads."

To be notified when costs approach your budget limit, you can create an alert. Reports is a visual tool in the Google Cloud console that allows you to monitor expenditure based on a project or services. Finally, Google Cloud also implements quotas, which are designed to prevent the over-consumption of resources because of an error or a malicious attack, protecting both account owners and the Google Cloud community as a whole."
