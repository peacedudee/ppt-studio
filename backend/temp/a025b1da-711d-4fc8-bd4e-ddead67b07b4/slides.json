In this section, we'll see how resources are organized with projects, and how access is shared through Identity and Access Management (IAM). We\u2019ll also look into the different ways in which you can interact with Google Cloud, including our web user interface, command-line interface, and our mobile apps."

    "speaker_notes": "The Google Cloud resource hierarchy is made up of four levels: resources, projects, folders, and an organization node. Resources represent virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, Virtual Private Networks (VPCs), tables in BigQuery, or anything else in Google Cloud. Resources get organized into projects. Projects can be organized into folders, or even subfolders. At the top level is an organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization."

    "speaker_notes": "Understanding the resource hierarchy is important because it directly relates to how policies are managed and applied when using Google Cloud. Policies can be defined at the project, folder, and organization node levels. Some Google Cloud services allow policies to be applied to individual resources, too. Policies are also inherited downward, meaning a policy applied to a folder will also apply to all of the projects within that folder."
