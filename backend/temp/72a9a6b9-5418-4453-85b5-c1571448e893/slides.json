    "speaker_notes": "Emerging markets ETFs focus on countries becoming developed markets. These include regions across Asia-Pacific and Latin America, such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, China, and India. These economies are characterized by rapid growth, high productivity, expanding middle class, high volatility, and liquidity in local debt and equity markets. Investors find these ETFs attractive because emerging economies tend to grow faster than their developed counterparts, demonstrating significant growth over the last decade."

    "speaker_notes": "The study focuses on three ETFs from BlackRock: iShares MSCI Chile ETF (ECH), iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ), and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). These ETFs represent emerging and developed markets, allowing for a nuanced analysis of predictive features and model performance. The analysis includes exploring the sectoral distribution within each ETF to understand how different economic activities influence performance. A classification strategy is used to predict a qualitative variable based on the opening price of the ETFs."

    "speaker_notes": "The study employs the CRISP-DM methodology, which includes six stages: understanding the data and the problem domain, data preparation, model construction, model evaluation, and presentation of results. Data preparation is a crucial stage involving cleaning, merging, scaling, and feature engineering to enhance data quality and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. This stage converts inconsistent and incomplete real-world data into a readable format."

    "speaker_notes": "The study uses an approach based on exploratory analysis and reduction of the input space to improve the accuracy of multiclass classification in machine learning. This feature selection effectively reduces dimensionality by selecting the subset of features that provide more information and dropping redundant ones. Techniques for selecting relevant features include low variance, Chi-squared, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), tree-based feature selection, Pearson\u2019s correlation, principal feature analysis, Mean Absolute Difference (MAD), and Dispersion Ratio (DR)."
