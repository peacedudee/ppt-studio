Resources represent virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, Virtual Private Networks (VPCs), tables in BigQuery, or anything else in Google Cloud. Resources get organized into projects. Projects can be organized into folders, or even subfolders. At the top level is an organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization."

Policies can be defined at the project, folder, and organization node levels. Some Google Cloud services allow policies to be applied to individual resources, too. Policies are also inherited downward. If you apply a policy to a folder, it will also apply to all of the projects within that folder."

The project ID is a globally unique identifier assigned by Google that cannot be changed\u2013they are immutable\u2013after creation. Project IDs are used in different contexts to inform Google Cloud of the exact project to work with. The project names, however, are user-created. They don\u2019t have to be unique and they can be changed at any time, so they are not immutable. Google Cloud also assigns each project a unique project number. It\u2019s helpful to know that these Google-generated numbers exist, but we won\u2019t explore them much in this course. They are mainly used internally, by Google Cloud, to keep track of resources."

The projects and subfolders in a folder contain resources that inherit policies and permissions assigned to that folder. A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders give teams the ability to delegate administrative rights so that they can work independently."
