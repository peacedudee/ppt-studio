For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Google Cloud resources. Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders give teams the ability to delegate administrative rights so that they can work independently."

These represent virtual machines, Cloud Storage buckets, Virtual Private Networks (VPCs), tables in BigQuery, or anything else in Google Cloud. Resources get organized into projects, which sit on the second level. Projects can be organized into folders, or even subfolders. These sit at the third level. And then at the top level is an organization node, which encompasses all the projects, folders, and resources in your organization."

Policies can be defined at the project, folder, and organization node levels, and some services allow policies at the individual resource level. Policies are inherited downward, meaning a policy applied to a folder applies to all projects within it. Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for effective policy management in Google Cloud."
